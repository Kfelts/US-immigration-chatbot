  utter_faq/perm_resid_requisites:

  utter_faq/perm_resid_and_temp_visa:
  - text: "Traditionally, visa officers have viewed concurrent applications for permanent residence and temporary entry as being incompatible with each other.\nCurrent law attempts to clarify the issue and provides that immigration officers must assess the present intention of the applicant when a person applies to visit Canada and verify the question of whether the applicant has the ability and the intention to enter Canada for a temporary purpose and thereafter leave Canada at the expiry of the visitor status, regardless if the long-term goal is to secure permanent residence in Canada. Visitor’s (work, study or visit) with pending immigrant applications may be subject to the issue of Dual Intent if they cannot demonstrate that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\nUnder current immigration policy, applicants are encouraged to become familiar with Canada’s landscape, which will augment the applicant’s likelihood of successfully integrating into Canadian society.\n Applicants are discouraged however from “waiting” inside Canada during the permanent residence application process.\n Applicants who wish to procure temporary entry into Canada and who have a pending application for permanent residence will be required to demonstrate sufficient ties to their current country of residence prior to the issuing of a temporary visitor’s visa by the Canadian visa office."

  utter_faq/temp_work_permit_and_perm_resid:
  - text: "The issues raised above should be reiterated here as well. In addition, applicants who wish to procure a temporary work permit must generally initiate the process with the assistance of the prospective employer who must file an application with the Canada Employment authorities inside Canada. It is only after the employment authorities have confirmed that the hiring in question will have a neutral effect on the local labour market that the application would be approved and forwarded to the appropriate visa office outside Canada for immigration assessment and processing. This is known as obtaining a positive “labour market opinion”.\n As the average processing time for permanent residence applications currently exceeds 12 months at most immigration offices, it may be advantageous in many cases, for the applicant to apply for a temporary work permit either prior to or during the processing of an application for permanent residence."

  utter_faq/canadian_labour_market:
  - text: "The Canadian immigration authorities are continuously revising programs and policies to reflect Canada’s changing labour market requirements.\n The current Regulations provide the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration with authority to set and amend the pass mark at any time during the process with no lock-in protection for an application under assessment.\n Qualified applicants who manifest a serious interest in obtaining permanent residence would be encouraged to proceed with the filing of the application(s) and the non refundable government filing fees in a timely fashion so as to initiate and conclude the processing at the earliest possible time.\nAs well, since the processing of a permanent resident visa application generally takes many months to complete, Canadian employers are often willing to consider sponsoring the candidacy of qualified foreign applicants under a temporary work visa.\n Applicants may therefore consider canvassing the Canadian labour market while simultaneously processing an application for permanent residence."

  utter_faq/job_prospects:
